            About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            I'm Dheeraj Anikar, an AI Engineer passionate about building intelligent systems and exploring the frontiers of AI capabilities. 
            I am equally passionate about making AI systems smarter and ensuring they don't accidentally decide to redecorate the planet. 
            When I'm not implementing RAG-based agents or fine-tuning LLMs, you'll find me diving deep into AI governance and safety discussions ‚Äì because someone needs to make sure our AI assistants don't get too creative with their interpretations of "help humanity".
        </p>
        <p>
            Armed with a Master's in Electrical Engineering from USC (Fight On! ‚úåÔ∏è) and a track record of building containment-crushing chatbots at Eltropy, I'm on a mission to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI capabilities and responsible implementation. 
            Think of me as the person who asks "Should we?" right after someone says "We can!"
        </p>
        <p>
            Off the keyboard, I'm a tennis enthusiast with a 3.5 UTR rating (still working on my Djokovic-inspired flexibility ‚Äì turns out becoming a human rubber band is harder than it looks üéæ). 
            I'm also a regular at AI safety conferences, where I contribute to discussions about keeping our AI systems as well-behaved as a tennis player during a quiet play point.
